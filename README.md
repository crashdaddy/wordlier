#Wordler#

The news keeps going on and on about this game called "Wordle"....so I built it myself for fun. It's less than 200 lines of code and it's basically just the algorithm from the old "Mastermind" game, but using words instead of numbers. I call it Wordler, and you can play it if you want at https://wordlr.herokuapp.com/ 

You can view the dictionary in /public/5LetterWords.txt (warning: the dictionary has like 5000 5-letter words and I've never heard of half of them)

There's a score counter that tracks games won by percentage and by points.

The point system is:

if you solve the puzzle on the

First guess: 1000pts

Second guess: 200pts

Third guess: 100pts

Fourth guess: 60pts

Fifth guess: 45 points

Sixth guess: 15points

Talk about incentive!

The little "graph" icon with the "x" on it next to the scores is how you reset the scores.  It does NOT ask if you're sure--it's like one of those sliding doors in Star Wars that just slams shut immediately.

Feel free to improve the game.  I think a little CSS animations here and there may tie the whole room together, but I haven't gotten to any of that yet.

Thank you for your interest!
